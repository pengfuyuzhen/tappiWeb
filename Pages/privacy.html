<h1 class = "legalHeader">Privacy Policy</h1>
<span>
<p class = "legalText">At <b>Tappi</b> we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul class = "legalText">
<li class = "legalText">We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
<li class = "legalText">We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li class = "legalText">We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>
<p class = "legalText">Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.</p>
<p class = "legalText">If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>
<p class = "legalText">Tappi (“Tappi”) operates an api and corresponding apps (on <a href="http://tappi.me/">http://tappi.me/</a>). It is Tappi’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our services.</p>
<h2 class = "legalTitle">Website Visitors</h2>
<p class = "legalText">Like most internet-service operators, Tappi collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers, apps and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Tappi’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tappi’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Tappi may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p class = "legalText">Tappi also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users that use the services and visitors.</p>
<h2 class = "legalTitle">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p class = "legalText">Certain visitors to Tappi’s websites and users of Tappi’s apps choose to interact with Tappi in ways that require Tappi to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Tappi gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users of our app to provide a phone number. In each case, Tappi collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Tappi. Tappi does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h2 class = "legalTitle">Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p class = "legalText">Tappi may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, Tappi does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h2 class = "legalTitle">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p class = "legalText">Tappi discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Tappi’s behalf or to provide services available at Tappi’s webservices, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Tappi’s webservices, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Tappi will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Tappi discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Tappi believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tappi, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Tappi and have supplied your email address, Tappi may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Tappi and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Tappi takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h2 class = "legalTitle">Cookies</h2>
<p class = "legalText">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Tappi uses cookies to help Tappi identify and track visitors, their usage of Tappi website, and their website access preferences. Tappi visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Tappi’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Tappi’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h2 class = "legalTitle">Business Transfers</h2>
<p class = "legalText">If Tappi, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Tappi goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Tappi may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h2 class = "legalTitle">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p class = "legalText">Although most changes are likely to be minor, Tappi may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Tappi’s sole discretion. Tappi encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of these services after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
